    "1.OOP offers easy to understand and a clear modular structure for programs.\n",
    "2.Objects created for Object-Oriented Programs can be reused in other programs.Thus it saves significant development cost.\n",
    "3.Large programs are difficult to write, but if the development and designing team follow OOPS concept then they can better design with minimum flaws.\n",
    "4.It also enhances program modularity because every object exists independently.\n",
    "5.It is possible to map objects in the problem domain to those objects in the program.Message passing technique for commun-ication between objects make the interface descriptions with external system much simpler \n",
    "6.Software complexity can easily be managed"
